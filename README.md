# Unexpected Pointer Behavior in C
This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily misunderstood aspect of C programming: pointer manipulation. 

The `bug.c` file contains code that exhibits unexpected behavior for those unfamiliar with how pointers work. Specifically, the program modifies the value of a variable indirectly through a pointer, leading to a result that might not be immediately obvious.

The `bugSolution.c` file offers a corrected approach and a more detailed explanation.
