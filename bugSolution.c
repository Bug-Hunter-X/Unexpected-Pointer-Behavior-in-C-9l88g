/*Corrected code*/ #include <stdio.h> int main() {int x = 10;int *ptr = &x; *ptr = 20;printf("%d\n", x); // Output: 20 return 0;} /*Explanation*/The core of the issue is how pointers work in C. A pointer holds the memory address of another variable. When you dereference the pointer using the asterisk (*), you are directly manipulating the value at that memory address. In this case, the memory address pointed to by 'ptr' is the same as that of 'x'. Therefore, assigning a new value using *ptr directly affects 'x'. This might seem trivial, but similar unexpected behavior can occur in more complex scenarios, especially when dealing with arrays and dynamic memory allocation. Therefore, careful handling of pointers is paramount for avoiding errors in C programming.
